AI powered by Minimax Algorithm

Prevents player from ever winning

Simple and easy-to-understand Python code

Great project for beginners to learn game theory and AI fundamentals

ðŸ§  About the Minimax Algorithm

Minimax is a recursive decision-making algorithm used in game theory and AI.

The AI assumes the opponent also plays optimally.

It minimizes the maximum possible loss, hence the name minimax.

Works best for turn-based, zero-sum games like Tic Tac Toe.
